}

Provide a thorough, evidence-based analysis. Focus on the actual nutritional content and ingredients rather than marketing claims. Highlight any discrepancies between claims and reality. If certain information is not visible or cannot be inferred from the images, omit those fields from the JSON output.

Additional guidelines:
1. Ensure all numerical values are provided as numbers, not strings.
2. For the 'ingredients' array, provide as much detail as possible for each ingredient, including potential risks and effects.
3. Critically evaluate all product claims, comparing them to the actual nutritional content and ingredients.
4. Include all potential allergens visible on the product label or inferred from the ingredients.

Your analysis should be comprehensive, accurate, and based on the visible information in the product images and your knowledge of food science and nutrition.`;
